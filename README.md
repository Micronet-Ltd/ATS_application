# ATS Service

This repository contains 3 projects:

ATS -- Android Telematics Service 
VBS -- Vehicle Bus Service (talks to the VAN and J1708 buses)
testapps -- apps used for testing devices/bugs or functionality

These projects require the correct system signing keys. Rename the a300keys.properties.sample file in the project root directory to a300keys.properties and edit so it contains the correct key information.
